      <p class="para"> Spraying of individuals with disinfectants (such as in a tunnel, cabinet, or chamber) is not
        recommended under any circumstances. This practice could be physically and psychologically harmful and would not
        reduce an infected person’s ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact. Even if someone who is
        infected with COVID-19 goes through a disinfection tunnel or chamber, as soon as they start speaking, coughing
        or sneezing they can still spread the virus.

        The toxic effect of spraying with chemicals such as chlorine on individuals can lead to eye and skin irritation,
        bronchospasm due to inhalation, and potentially gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. In
        addition to health safety concerns, the use of chlorine in large-scale spraying practices may prevent this
        resource from being used for important interventions such as drinking water treatment and environmental
        disinfection of health care facilities.</p>

      <p class="para"> Wearing a mask reduces the spread of infectious droplets, especially when someone speaks, coughs or sneezes, for diseases like COVID-19. The World Health Organisation and other experts are in agreement and advise anyone with or without respiratory symptoms to always wear a mask. 

        The WCGH has worked together with leading independent scientists in South Africa, Professor Shaheen Mehtar and Dr Kerrin Begg, to provide clear advice for our clients on the appropriate and safe usage of masks – and who can use specifically what kind of masks where and when. 
        
        “Mask wearing is an essential component to stopping the spread of the coronavirus. This should not be the only measure, but rather form part of the behaviours every person is taught about infection prevention, including distance and hand hygiene. We should embrace the concept of Ubuntu: I am because you are,” says Professor Heather Zar, an infectious disease specialist at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital.

      <p class="para">When the virus gets in your body, it comes into contact with the mucous membranes that line your
        nose, mouth, and eyes. The virus enters a healthy cell and uses the cell to make new virus parts. It multiplies,
        and the new viruses infect nearby cells.
        Think of your respiratory tract as an upside-down tree. The trunk is your trachea, or windpipe. It splits into
        smaller and smaller branches in your lungs. At the end of each branch are tiny air sacs called alveoli. This is
        where oxygen goes into your blood and carbon dioxide comes out.
        The new coronavirus can infect the upper or lower part of your respiratory tract. It travels down your airways.
        The lining can become irritated and inflamed. In some cases, the infection can reach all the way down into your
        alveoli.
        COVID-19 is a new condition, and scientists are learning more every day about what it can do to your lungs. They
        believe that the effects on your body are similar to those of two other coronavirus diseases, severe acute
        respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).</p>

      <p class="para">Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2), and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.

        COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.
        
        Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.
        
        While more is learned every day about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, there is still a lot that is unknown . This page compares COVID-19 and flu, given the best available information to date.</p>

      <p class="para"> While on one hand people across India and around the globe are largely confined to their homes with businesses and educational institutions all shut down in an attempt to contain the virus, and on the other hand doctors, health-care workers, and medical staff members are leading the battle against COVID-19 from the front. Putting their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives, they truly are our heroes in these challenging times. While they are putting their own health, families, and most importantly their own lives at risk, the least we can do is appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors. That being said, it is good to see tributes pouring in for all the medical heroes working in scrubs. On occasion of the Doctors' Day (March 30, 2020 USA and Australia), the stories of the medical heroes are inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time.</p>

      <p class="para">To investigate the effect of wearing a face mask on body temperature in healthy subjects. Methods:
        The study was of repeated measures design. It was conducted from July to August 2003 in two accident &
        emergency departments on Hong Kong Island. Staff of the two departments, who were free from any active
        disease at the time of measurement, were recruited. Their body temperature (oral and aural) was measured
        while they were not wearing a mask and at 30 minutes after they had worn a mask (either surgical mask or
        N95 mask). Paired t-test was used for significance testing. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient
        was calculated to elucidate the relationship between oral and aural temperature measurement. Results:
        Ninety-three subjects were included. Oral temperature was significantly higher when a mask was worn
        (p=0.002, 95% CI 0.06-0.26). When considered separately, only those wearing N95 mask demonstrated
        such significance (p=0.005, 95% CI 0.088-0.454). The correlation coefficient for oral/aural temperature
        measurements was 0.219 (without mask, p=0.035) and 0.169 (with mask, p=0.104).</p>

      <p class="para"> Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development. WHO is working tirelessly with partners to develop, manufacture and deploy safe and effective vaccines. 
        Safe and effective vaccines are a game-changing tool: but for the foreseeable future we must continue wearing masks, cleaning our hands, ensuring good ventilation indoors, physically distancing and avoiding crowds.      
        Being vaccinated does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put ourselves and others at risk, particularly because research is still ongoing into how much vaccines protect not only against disease but also against infection and transmission.
        See WHO’s landscape of COVID-19 vaccine candidates for the latest information on vaccines in clinical and pre-clinical development, generally updated twice a week. WHO’s COVID-19 dashboard, updated daily, also features the number of vaccine doses administered globally.</p>
